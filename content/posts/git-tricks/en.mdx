Git is an excellent and popular tool, but it is too old that many new challenges must be addressed accordingly. This post records the problems and the solutions.

# Proxy

In China, the most significant obstacle is the censorship. Occassionally even GitHub is blocked from access. In such case, a proxy that can bypass the firewall is necessary. According to [this gist][git-proxy], git can be set to use proxy for certain domains by:

```bash
git config --global http.https://<domain.com.proxy> http://<proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxy.server.com:port>
```
