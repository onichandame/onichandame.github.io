Systemd is a useful tool programmatically managing routine tasks. I encountered a specific situation with some constraints:

1. start task on boot as a non-root user
2. auto restart on failure

The solution to this issue is to create a systemd task as the non-root user.

# Steps

## Create the service

```bash
systemctl edit --user --full --force <service_name>
```

## add the content

```text
[Unit]
Description=<Service>

[Service]
Restart=always
ExecStart=<Servece_Start>
ExecStop=<Service_Stop>

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

the last line registers the service to the dependency list for auto-start

## enable the service

```bash
systemctl enable --user <service_name>
```

## (optional) enable linger

```bash
 sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
```

This is to allow the service continuing to run after the user is logged out.

# Podman Service

When running podman container as a systemd service, the `ExecStart` command should be `podman start -a <container_name>` and the `ExecStop` command should be `podman stop -t <seconds_to_wait> <container_name>`. Details can be found at <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html/managing_containers/running_containers_as_systemd_services_with_podman>
